Design Thinking Reflection:

As a first-year student, my dream is to build a successful career where I can create impactful solutions and contribute positively to my industry. Recently, I worked on a lecturer-assigned design thinking project with my group, where we developed a **sign language app** to enhance communication between disabled and non-disabled individuals.  

This project taught me how to think creatively, prioritize user needs, and design practical solutions while emphasizing empathy and inclusivity.  

To achieve my career goals, I plan to gain hands-on experience through internships, stay updated on the latest technologies, and improve my teamwork and communication skills. These steps will help me grow and make a meaningful impact in the field of technology and innovation.  
Let me know if it needs further adjustments!
