Industry Visit 2 Reflection:
The visit to UTM Digital was highly beneficial for students from the Faculty of Computing as it provided valuable insights into how essential apps like UTM Smart and the UTM portal are developed and maintained. It allowed us to connect theoretical knowledge with practical applications, particularly through UTMID’s integration across various platforms. During the visit, we learned about the technologies used, the challenges faced by the team, and future features of the apps, which made us excited about what’s to come. The session also highlighted the importance of teamwork, innovation, and collaboration in the software development process. Overall, the visit enhanced our understanding of the course material and made it more relevant by showing how the concepts we study are applied in real-world scenarios.
